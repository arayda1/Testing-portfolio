# AI Testing Project

## Project Description
This project focuses on the testing of an AI model to ensure its accuracy and performance. The testing involves various stages, including data validation, model performance evaluation, and stress testing under different conditions.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: For scripting and automation.
- **TensorFlow**: For building and testing AI models.
- **PyTest**: For creating and running test cases.

## Test Cases
b
1. **Model Accuracy**
   - **Description**: Validate the accuracy of the AI model with a test dataset.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Load the test dataset.
     2. Run the model on the test dataset.
     3. Compare the model's predictions with the actual results.
   - **Expected Result**: The model achieves the desired accuracy.

2. **Performance Under Load**
   - **Description**: Test the model's performance under high load.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Simulate a high number of requests to the model.
     2. Monitor the model's response time and accuracy.
   - **Expected Result**: The model maintains performance and accuracy.

## Results

- **Accuracy Report**: Detailed report on model accuracy with various datasets.
- **Performance Metrics**: Data on the model's performance under different loads.
- **Bug Reports**: Any issues found during testing with steps to reproduce and suggestions for fixes.
